        <h3>
          Inspired by a phrase that the artistâ€™s father said during his last days in the hospital, <em>Terra Infirma: Hospital Room for Someone Who Can Never Go Home Again</em> re-imagines a hospital room with surreal and organic touches, and invites interaction through audio and point-and-click mechanics. By incorporating concepts of geopsychology and ritual, Terra Infirma examines the shortcomings of the healthcare industry related to immigrant and first-generation care and asks us to evaluate what it means to be cared for and listened to far away from home.
